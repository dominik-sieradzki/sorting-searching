Believed to be responsible for hiring an assassin to murder Bran Stark while he lay in a coma, Tywin's son Tyrion is arrested at the inn at the crossroads by Catelyn Stark, the wife of Eddard Stark, current Hand of the King. She takes him to her sister Lysa, at the Eyrie, for trial. Though Tywin does not care about Tyrion's welfare, he sees the arrest and kidnapping as a direct slight on House Lannister's honor which he will not tolerate. In response Tywin sends Ser Gregor Clegane and the Mountain's men, disguised as brigands, to sack and pillage various villages and hamlets across the riverlands, Catelyn's homeland.[22] These raids mark one of the seminal points in what is to become the War of the Five Kings.

Tywin's aim is to draw Eddard out of King's Landing, capture him, and exchange him for the freedom of his son.[23] Eddard, however, is injured in a skirmish on the streets of King's Landing with Tywin's son Jaime, who is unaware of Tywin's plans, and Eddard sends Lord Beric Dondarrion after Gregor in his stead. When Beric's forces reach the Mummer's Ford, soldiers of Tywin's and Gregor's attack from all sides, routing Beric's host.[24]

As the war gains momentum, Tywin's forces take the majority of the riverlands and lay siege to Riverrun before meeting their first real opposition in the battle on the Green Fork. Just prior to the battle, Tyrion, having won his freedom from the Vale of Arryn via trial by combat and earned the loyalty of many of the Vale mountain clans along the way, meets with his father. Tywin sends Tyrion and his clansmen into the battle on the left flank, believing the undisciplined men likely to rout, but giving the northern commander, which Tywin believed to be the young and inexperienced Robb Stark, a chance to over-commit and be annihilated.[25] The clansmen do not rout, however, and the northern commander is not Robb but instead the more cautious and experienced Lord Roose Bolton. The battle is a Lannister victory, but it buys enough time for a separate northern force under Robb Stark's command to cross the Trident at the Twins. With the battle in the Whispering Wood and the Battle of the Camps, Robb is able to capture Tywin's other son, Jaime, and lift the siege of Riverrun.[26]

After the death of King Robert I Baratheon, Tywin is named Hand of the King for his grandson, Joffrey I Baratheon.[27] Tywin does not trust the "jackanapes" on the small council: master of coin Petyr Baelish, Pycelle, and master of whisperers Varys. After the battle he sends Tyrion to King's Landing to serve as Hand in his stead, control the small council and Joffrey, and to prepare the city's defenses in anticipation of an attack from one or both of Robert's brothers, Stannis and Renly, while Tywin manages the war with the North and the Riverlands.[26]

A Clash of Kings
The loss of Riverrun means that Tywin is not able to pursue and destroy Roose Bolton's forces. Instead he marches south to Harrenhal while he ponders his next move. Lannister men in the riverlands are harassed by Beric Dondarrion's outlaw brotherhood, despite Beric having been reported as slain several times.[19]

Robb Stark, now the King in the North, marches from Riverrun and invades the westerlands, smashing a new Lannister host being raised and trained by Stafford Lannister at Oxcross and turning his forces loose to scour the westerlands. With Renly mysteriously killed and the loyalties of his men disputed,[28][29] Tywin leaves Harrenhal and marches his forces west in pursuit of Robb,[30] gambling that Stannis will be occupied with the siege of Storm's End.[31][32] With Tywin gone, however, the Brave Companions abandon the Lannister cause and betray Harrenhal to Lord Bolton.[33]

Robb and Ser Brynden Tully plan to lead Tywin's army on a long chase across the westerlands, bleeding his forces and living off of their lands.[34] However, Ser Edmure Tully, who has been tasked with holding Riverrun but is unaware of Robb's plan, meets Tywin's army in the field in the Battle of the Fords.[35] Tywin's forces are bloodied and thrown back, but the delay allows word to reach Tywin that Stannis has unexpectedly[31] taken formidable Storm's End and laid claim to much of Renly's army, and that he is marching and sailing on King's Landing with an enormous force.[36][32]

Tywin turns his host southeast on a forced march to the headwaters of the Blackwater Rush, where he meets Lords Mathis Rowan and Randyll Tarly of the newly-allied Reach. They then join with the forces of Lord Mace Tyrell at Tumbler's Falls.[34] Sailing together on barges down the Blackwater Rush, the Lannisters and Tyrells arrive just in time for the waning moments of the Battle of the Blackwater, where they are able to break and drive away the majority of Stannis's army, which had been on the cusp of victory, by taking them in the flank.[34] Tywin commands the host's right flank during the battle.[37] Tywin is declared Savior of the City by King Joffrey I Baratheon. Tywin's son Tyrion, who had done much for the city's defenses, is critically wounded in the fighting.[38]
